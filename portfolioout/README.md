# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Install dependencies

1. run `npm install` in `terminal` to install all dependencies, if `npm` is not installed, install `npm` first. This command will let `npm` help you install all required dependencies from `package.json`
2. run `npm start` in `terminal` to start the app, browser should open itself when it is running.
